# spacetraders-hq

This is a web-based GUI built on Vue.js for the Space Traders game.

[Space Traders](spacetraders.io) is a game played via REST API calls - that makes it a wonderful platform to learn and develop your skills (e.g., I've never worked with Vue.js before!).

Because of this "education-bias" I have in this project, it is not intended to be a very good GUI for the game itself (but it should be a reasonable option, of course) and it will take some time to implement all the features I would like it to have.

Feel free to help me - give me challenges, report bugs, suggest refactories or just ask for new functionalities!
